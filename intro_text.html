<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Artefact Removal Benchmarking Tool </strong></h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">An interactive open source software tool for benchmarking artifact detection and removal techniques.</h4>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Different sources of noise are present in the brain, and to accurately understand the brain functionality, they must be removed a priory of the study. Due to the nature and complexity of both neuronal signals and artefacts, computational techniques provide powerful tools for their detection and removal. Despite many studies available in the literature, there is no study that facilitates the selection of an appropriate method for a given signal. Here we present an online benchmarking tool that has been developed to aid an appropriate selection of machine learning based methods and to compare obtained results with the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;<strong>HOW TO USE THE TOOL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">The first tab "Comparison Plots'', contains the input for the user to input the metrics of their approach (training examples, features extracted, hyperparameters, select which performance metric they have used and its value). The app takes these inputs and plots them in the distribution of values obtained from the bibliography, which the user can filter according to their interest.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">The second tab "Comparison Table'', contains the table with the methodologies found across the literature. This entails their details: reference, year, signal ,method, artefact, metric, result, training examples, features, hyperparameters, normalised performance and score. The user can select how many entries are shown, filter trough each detail, define intervals in numeric details, or use keywords to search specific ones.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">The last tab "References Table'', contains the list of complete references, which can be sorted by author or key words as well.</li>
</ul>
